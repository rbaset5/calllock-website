## How It Works Section

**Section Header:**
```
Label: THE WORKFLOW
Headline: How It Works
```

### Step 1
```
Icon: ring_volume
Number: 1

Headline: Call Comes In

Body: Customer calls your number. You're on a job, after hours, or just busy. After a few rings, CallLock takes over the live call.
```

### Step 2
```
Icon: smart_toy
Number: 2

Headline: AI Takes Over

Body: Your AI receptionist qualifies the caller. What do you need? Where are you located? How urgent? Then books them directly onto your calendar.
```

### Step 3
```
Icon: check_circle
Number: 3

Headline: You Get Notified

Body: You receive an instant text with all the details. The job is on your calendar. The customer is waiting for you—not calling your competitor.
```

---

## Comparison Section

### Without CallLock (Left Column - Red)
```
Headline: Without CallLock

• Missed calls go to voicemail—customers hang up and call someone who answers
• Phone tag delays booking by hours or days
• Monday morning rush? Someone's always waiting on hold
• After-hours calls go straight to your competitor
```

### With CallLock (Right Column - Green)
```
Headline: With CallLock

• Every call answered instantly—customer stays on the line
• Jobs booked on first contact, no callback needed
• Handle 50 calls simultaneously, no one waits
• 24/7 coverage—capture jobs while you sleep
```

---

## Surge Capture Section (NEW)

```
Label: THE SURGE CAPTURE ADVANTAGE

Headline: When Everyone Calls at Once

Body:
Monday morning rush. First cold snap. Summer heatwave.

Here's the dirty secret of answering services: you aren't their only client. When a storm hits, all their Trades Home Service clients get busy at the same time. Their staff gets overwhelmed, and your customers end up waiting in line behind another Trades Home Service company's customers.

With CallLock, you have your own infinite lane. 50 calls at the exact same second? Every single one gets answered.

Tagline: You capture the entire surge while competitors are stuck in a queue.
```

## FAQ Section

**Section Header:**
```
Headline: Questions? Answered.
```

### FAQ 1
```
Q: Will customers know it's AI?

A: Most don't notice. And honestly? This AI is more polite than most receptionists you've encountered. No bad days, no attitude—friendly and professional, every single time.
```

### FAQ 2
```
Q: How is this different from an answering service?

A: Answering services take messages. You call back hours later. By then, the customer hired someone else.

CallLock is different: the caller stays on the line and books right there. No message, no callback, no delay. And here's the thing—answering services share staff across all their Trades Home Service clients. When it's busy, your customers wait in line behind your competitors' customers. With CallLock, you have your own infinite lane.
```

### FAQ 3
```
Q: How fast can I get set up?

A: Live in under 30 minutes. Forward your missed/busy calls to your CallLock number, and the AI handles everything from there.
```

### FAQ 4
```
Q: What happens during peak volume?

A: That's the beauty of AI. We handle 5, 50, or 500 calls simultaneously. You never get a busy signal. Your customers never wait on hold.
```

### FAQ 5
```
Q: Can I take over a call if I need to?

A: Yes. Live Call Takeover lets you jump into any active AI call seamlessly. You're always in control.

Headline: Our Mission

Body:
Great Trades Home Service businesses lose money every day—not because they do bad work, but because they're too busy doing good work to answer the phone.

That job? Gone. To your competitor.

We built CallLock to fix that. When you can't answer, your AI receptionist takes over the live call. The customer gets qualified and booked. You get notified.

The customer never hung up, never called your competitor.
